+-----------------------------+
| STRING CONTROL CODES        |
+-----------------------------+

Enter these control codes into a message string for special formatting, effects, basic dialog
branching, or modification. (Argument values should be a number from 0 to 9999.)

+-----------------------------+
| FORMATTING CODES            |
+-----------------------------+

\1\cset\ramp - Text Colour. Changes the following text to a certain colour. 
Argument 1 is the CSet, and argument 2 is the colour within that CSet. 
The text in the Preview Pane changes to reflect the addition and modification of this Control Code. 

\2\newspeed - Text Speed. Changes the length of the delay between text characters appearing. 
If 0, text appears instantaneously. Argument 1 is the speed. 

\25 - New Line. Equivalent to pressing Enter in a document. Best used when text wrapping is enabled.

\32 through \126 - ASCII Character. Prints a character based on its ASCII code. For example, \91 allows you to display a backslash.

+-----------------------------+
| SWITCH CODES                |
+-----------------------------+

    (Note: If you switch to a string that hasn't been created yet, then ZC will act as if you switched to a string with no characters in it. )

\3\register\value\newstring - Goto If Screen Variable. If one of the Screen->D[] variables of the current screen 
is at or above a certain value, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is the index into the screen's D array, 
argument 2 is the value, and argument 3 is the string to switch to. 

\4\factor\newstring - Goto If Random. There is a one-in-(argument 1) chance that ZC switches to another string (argument 2). 

\5\itemID\newstring - Goto If Item. If Link has a certain item, then ZC switches to another string. Argument 1 is 
the item ID, and argument 2 is the string to switch to. 

\6\counter\value\newstring - Goto If Counter. If a counter is at or above a certain value, then ZC switches 
to another string. Argument 1 is the counter, argument 2 is the value, and argument 3 is the string to switch to. 

\7\counter\value\newstring - Goto If Counter %. If a counter is at or above a certain percentage of its 
maximum, then ZC switches to another string. 

\8\levelID\newstring - Goto If Triforce. If Link has acquired the Triforce from a certain level, then ZC switches to 
another string. Argument 1 is the level, and argument 2 is the string to switch to. 

\9\quantity\newstring - Goto If Triforce Count. If Link has acquired a certain number of Triforce pieces, then ZC switches 
to another string. Argument 1 is the quantity, and argument 2 is the string to switch to.

+-----------------------------+
| COUNTER UP/DOWN CODES       |
+-----------------------------+

\10\counter\value - Counter Up. Increases a counter by a certain value. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the value. 

\11\counter\value - Counter Down. Reduces a counter by a certain value. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the value. 

\12\counter\value - Counter Set. Sets a counter to a certain value. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the value. 

\13\counter\value - Counter Up %. Increases a counter by a certain percentage of its maximum. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the percentage. 

\14\counter\value - Counter Down %. Reduces a counter by a certain percentage of its maximum. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the percentage. 

\15\counter\value - Counter Set %. Sets a counter to a certain percentage of its maximum. 
Argument 1 is the counter, and argument 2 is the percentage. 

\16\itemID - Give Item. An item is silently added to Link's inventory. 
Link does not hold up the item, and the item's Pickup Script does not run - though the item's counter modifications will still take effect. 
Argument 1 is the item ID. 

\17\itemID - Take Item. An item is removed from Link's inventory. 
The item's counter modifications will be undone when this occurs. Argument 1 is the item ID.

+-----------------------------+
| MISC CODES                  |
+-----------------------------+

\18\dmap\screen\x\y\effect\sound - Warps Link to a specific dmap, and screen, at coordinates x, y.

If x is negative, y is used for the warp return point (0 to 3; 5 for pit warp).
	Valid effects: 
		0 == none, 1 == Zap, 2 == Wave, 4 == Mosaic, 5 == Opening Wipe
	If sound arg is a valid sound effect, then ZC will play that sound during the transition.

\19\dmap\screen\register\value - Sets Screen->D[reg] for dmap, screen, to value.

+-----------------------------+
| AUDIO EFFECT CODES          |
+-----------------------------+

\20\soundID - Sound Effect. Argument 1 is the sound effect number. 

\21\midiID - Play MIDI. Argument 1 is the quest MIDI number. You cannot play the built-in MIDIs using this.
